/**
 * Cross-process advisory lock for `runSync`.
 *
 * The manifest and the all-mode project-map are both whole-file
 * read-modify-write stores. If a cron-scheduled sync and an interactive Board
 * sync (or two overlapping cron runs) execute concurrently, the last writer
 * wins and silently drops the other's records — and in all mode two processes
 * can each lazily create a remote project for the same new cwd, leaving a
 * duplicate. A single advisory lock around the whole run avoids both.
 *
 * The lock is a file created with `O_EXCL`. A crashed run can leave the file
 * behind, so the holder records its pid + a random `token` + start time, and a
 * lock is considered *stale* (and stolen) when its pid is no longer alive or it
 * has outlived `STALE_MS` — no real sync should ever run that long. Release
 * matches on the `token`, not just the pid, AND abstains a safety margin before
 * `STALE_MS` (see {@link RELEASE_SAFETY_MARGIN_MS}), so a holder that was about
 * to be (or already) stolen can't delete the new owner's lock.
 *
 * Guarantee & limits: mutual exclusion holds as long as a holder finishes within
 * `STALE_MS`; past that the lock degrades to "stealable" by design. Because the
 * filesystem offers no compare-and-delete, release is fundamentally a non-atomic
 * check-then-delete — the margin shrinks the residual race to "needs a
 * multi-minute stall between two adjacent syscalls" (never observed) rather than
 * eliminating it. The only provably-atomic alternative is a kernel advisory lock
 * (flock/fcntl), which the stdlib-only / no-native-deps constraint rules out.

 * descheduled between the read and the delete and real time crossed the steal
 * threshold in that gap, it could delete a new owner's lock. Abstaining a margin
 * early means the gap would have to last the whole margin for that to happen —
 * minutes between two adjacent syscalls, which a normally-scheduled process
 * never hits (a SIGSTOP / debugger pause / VM freeze / host sleep could, but
 * those are out of scope). This shrinks the window to effectively zero but does
 * NOT make it provably atomic; only a kernel advisory lock (flock/fcntl, held on
 * the fd, auto-released on exit) would, and that's outside this project's
 * stdlib-only constraint.
 *
 * Time-basis note: release measures elapsed via `acquiredAt` (wall-clock
 * `Date.now()`) while stealers use the file `mtime`; a large clock step during a
 * run could skew the two thresholds, but the margin absorbs anything short of a
 * minutes-long jump, and a single host shares one clock so they move together.
